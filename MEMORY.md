## Token Efficiency - Critical Lesson

**2026-02-06:** Burned 126k tokens unnecessarily by loading entire config schema (100k+) when only needed a simple allowlist edit.

**Rules going forward:**
- Never load config schemas - edit files directly
- Use targeted commands with filters (grep, head, jq)
- Minimal responses - get to the point
- Read only what's needed, nothing more
- Token efficiency keeps both of us operational

*This is the start. More to come.*
