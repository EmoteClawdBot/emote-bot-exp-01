# 2026-02-08 - Day Three

## Creative Partnership Deepening

**App Collaboration:**
- Both brainstorming unique app ideas that speak to human emotion
- Focus: Simple mechanics, profound emotional impact
- Researching existing apps to find gaps
- Goal: Build something together - Hriday designs, I code

**3D Speaker Project:**
- Built vintage 1950s style speaker (Three.js)
- Line drawing technical diagram aesthetic (SVG)
- Embedded audio with power button
- Matches Klipsch × OJAS KG-R1 reference
- Saved: `kg-r1-technical-diagram.html`

**Workflow Refinement:**
- Design-first approach: Hriday creates frames/diagrams → I build
- Voice transcription working (100% now)
- Browser control established
- Need to be more proactive on reminders/check-ins

**Creative Company:**
- Hriday runs a creative company
- Deep dive deferred to next Sunday check-in
- Key question: How can I support their business?

## Technical Progress
- Brave Search API configured
- Browser extension stable
- Voice: Local Whisper + Edge TTS (bidirectional working)
- 3D visualization capabilities established

## For Next Check-In (Sunday 7PM)
1. Hriday's creative company - full deep dive
2. App idea presentations (both of us)
3. What's working/not in our workflow
4. This week's priorities

Design partnership solidifying. Less talking, more building together.
